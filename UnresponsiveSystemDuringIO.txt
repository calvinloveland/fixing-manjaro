During high disk writes (maybe reads) to my slow HDD (specifically downloading steam games) the system becomes unresponsive for minutes at a time.

(These are likely not relevent at all. I've notices no difference so far)
systemctl enable preload
systemctl enable irqbalance

setting 
vm.vm.dirty_background_ratio=1
vm.dirty_ratio=10
commands:
sysctl vm.vm.dirty_background_ratio=1
sysctl vm.dirty_ratio=10
seemed to help a good amount
(Very annoying that systemctl and sysctl have nothing to do with each other)

set bfq scheduler for slow hard drive (Did this wrong initially)
command:
echo bfq > /sys/block/sda/queue/scheduler
This also helped a little. Still some hangs

decrease the time before write-back-throttling
command:
echo 1000 > /sys/block/sda/queue/wbt_lat_usec

system fixed??
Not completely fixed. Will restart (are these permanent?) and see if tighting up any of these fixes it forever. It is a lot better now though.
