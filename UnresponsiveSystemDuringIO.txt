During high disk writes (maybe reads) to my slow HDD (specifically downloading steam games) the system becomes unresponsive for minutes at a time.

(These are likely not relevent at all. I've notices no difference so far)
systemctl enable preload
systemctl enable irqbalance

setting 
vm.vm.dirty_background_ratio=1
vm.dirty_ratio=10
commands:
sysctl vm.vm.dirty_background_ratio=1
sysctl vm.dirty_ratio=10
seemed to help a good amount
(Very annoying that systemctl and sysctl have nothing to do with each other)

set bfq scheduler for slow hard drive (Did this wrong initially)
command:
echo bfq > /sys/block/sda/queue/scheduler
^^^^
WRONG
correct:
echo bfq > /sys/block/sdc/queue/scheduler
This also helped a little. Still some hangs

decrease the time before write-back-throttling
command:
echo 1000 > /sys/block/sda/queue/wbt_lat_usec
^^^^
WRONG
correct:
echo 1000 > /sys/block/sda/queue/wbt_lat_usec

system fixed??
Not completely fixed. Will restart (are these permanent?) and see if tighting up any of these fixes it forever. It is a lot better now though.
GODDAMMIT SDC NOT SDA SDC NOT SDA
add udev rules to set wbt times for sdc. Maybe should set these for sda, my fast drive, since my copy paste errors seemed to help?
udev rules in 

cat /etc/udev/rules.d/60-ioscheduler.rules                                                                                                                       
ACTION=="add|change", KERNEL=="sd[a-z]", ATTR{queue/rotational}=="1", ATTR{queue/scheduler}="bfq"
ACTION=="add|change", KERNEL=="sd[a-z]", ATTR{queue/rotational}=="1", ATTR{queue/wbt_lat_usec}="10000"

also maybe steam is dumping these on my main drive anyway? Why is my drive full? Why don't symlinks ever work like I expect? Why doesn't steam let me point to a full library folder? A mystery...
